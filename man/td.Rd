\description{
  Perform temporal disaggregation or interpolation of low
  frequency to high frequency time series. \code{td} can be
  used with objects of class \code{"\link{ts}"} as well as
  with basic vectors.
}
\details{
  \code{td} is used to disaggregate or interpolate a low
  frequency to a higher frequency time series, while either
  the sum, the average, the first or the last value of the
  resulting high-frequency series is consistent with the
  low frequency series. Disaggregation can be performed
  with or without the help of one or more indicator series.
  It can deal with all situations where the high frequency
  is an integer multiple of the low frequency (e.g. weeks
  to days), but not with irregular frequencies (e.g. weeks
  to months).

  The selection of a temporal disaggregation model is
  similar to the selection of a linear regression model.
  Thus, \code{td} closely mirrors the working of the
  \code{\link{lm}} function. The left hand side of the
  \code{\link{formula}} denotes the low-frequency series,
  the right hand side the indicators. If no indicator is
  specified, the right hand side must be set equal to
  \code{1} (see examples). Unlike \code{lm}, \code{td}
  handles \code{\link{ts}} and \code{mts} time-series
  objects, as a typical application involves the use of
  these objects. Alternatively, If used with basic vectors,
  the \code{to} argument specifies the ratio between the
  high and the low frequency series.

  For the generalized least squares (GLS) methods
  \code{"chow-lin-maxlog"},
  \code{"chow-lin-minrss-ecotrim"},
  \code{"chow-lin-minrss-quilis"},
  \code{"litterman-maxlog"} and \code{"litterman-minrss"},
  an autoregressive parameter \eqn{\rho} is estimated.
  Default (and recommended) method is
  \code{chow-lin-maxlog}. With \code{truncated.rho = 0}
  (default), it produces good results for a wide range of
  applications.

  There are two variants of the \code{chow-lin-minrss}
  approach that lead to different results: Ecotrim by
  Barcellan (2003) uses a correlation matrix instead of the
  variance covariance matrix (implemented in
  \code{"chow-lin-minrss-ecotrim"}), the Matlab library by
  Quilis (2009) multiplies the correlation matrix with
  \eqn{1/(1-\rho^2)} (implemented in
  \code{"chow-lin-minrss-quilis"}).

  The Denton methods \code{"denton"} and
  \code{"denton-cholette"} can be specified with one or
  without an indicator. The parameter \code{h} can be set
  equal to \code{0}, \code{1}, or \code{2}. Depending on
  the value, the \code{denton} procedure minimizes the sum
  of squares of the deviations between the levels
  (\code{0}), the first differences (\code{1}) or the
  second differences (\code{2}) of the indicator and the
  resulting series. Additionally, \code{criterion} can be
  set equal to \code{"proportional"} or \code{"additive"},
  depending on whether the proportional or the absolute
  deviations should be considered for minimzation.
  \code{"denton-cholette"} removes the transient movement
  of the original \code{"denton"} method at the beginning
  of the resulting series.

  \code{"uniform"} is a special case of the \code{"denton"}
  approach, with \code{h} equals \code{0} and
  \code{criterion} equals \code{"proportional"}. It
  distributes the residuals uniformly. If no indicator is
  used, this leads to a step-shaped series.

  \code{"ols"} performs an ordinary least squares
  regression (OLS) and distributes the residuals uniformly.
  It is especially useful for comparing the estimators of
  GLS and OLS regressions.
