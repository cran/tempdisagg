\title{Methods for Temporal Disaggregation and Interpolation of Time Series}
\description{
Temporal disaggregation methods are used to disaggregate or 
  interpolate a low frequency time series to higher frequency series, where 
  either the sum, the average, the first or the last value of the resulting 
  high frequency series is consistent with the low frequency series. Temporal
  disaggregation can be performed with or without one or more high frequency 
  indicator series.
  
  A good way to start is to run the interactive demo:
  
  \code{demo(tempdisagg)}
  
  Our article on temporal disaggregation of time series
  (\url{http://journal.r-project.org/archive/2013-2/sax-steiner.pdf}) describes the package and the theory of temporal disaggregation
  in more detail.
